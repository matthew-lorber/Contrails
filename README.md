# Contrails
[Contrails]() is an AR group mapping and trail following app in React Native, MySQL, Express and Node.js. It was created to help my hiking groups keep track of participants out on the trail. 

### *How can you use it?*
Use it on your hikes, to find your car, family, or friend(s); for example, keep track of each other while going to / at events.

## How It Works
From within the app, the group organizer creates an event, then sends invites to participants. If a participant does not have a Contrails account, it will send a link via text message to dowload the app. At the beginning of the event, the group leader and all members start the app and appear on each others' maps. During the hike, the leader's position and path is shown both on a map and in AR via the device's camera, and all hikers' positions are plotted on everyone's map, in case the group gets strung out. The leader has the option of adding markers and other tracking info, and the group can send group or direct messages at any time. When the hike is through, the leader stops the app and it returns localized data including the trip length, elevation change, elapsed time, pace between markers legs, etc.

## Instructions
Not only will it be easier for developers to know how to fork the project or become involved with the project, but it will be easy for non-coders to understand what the code is designed to do, and how they, too, can become involved. ***Important*** We also recommend separating the sections for using a project versus developing for it. (More detailed instructions are located in our guidelines for writing documentation for users, contributors, and developers.)
### Use
### Develop
### Test
### Contribute
We explicitly welcome outside contributors. It’s important to explicitly state how they can help and what they can help with. This part of the website should answer the question: How can outside contributors become involved? We include a CONTRIBUTING.md file in each repo, which outlines the following:

***If there are any additional setup steps specific for development.***
Whether there are explicit Instructions for running tests before contributions are accepted.
If there are any requirements for contribution, if any, e.g.
A Contributor License Agreement
CLAHub
http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla
http://contributoragreements.org/
If commits should be squashed
Whether there is a specific coding style to adhere to. (Generally contributors will match what they see within a project.)
Whether potential contributors should ask before they make significant changes.
Whether work-in-progress pull requests are ok.
What 18F's Code of Conduct states
Example: The README for Midas contains a section called “How you can help.” What we really like about this section is that it doesn’t assume helpers are developers and lists ways for lots of different people to contribute. (Our guide to welcoming non-coders to hackathons also contains many suggestions for ways to involve people with different skillsets.)

We also recommend reading Midas’ Contributor’s Guide, which orients new dev contributors and tells them the best ways to communicate with Midas’ dev team.


## License
List the licensing information for your project.
This part of the repo should answer the question: What is the license for this project? All 18F projects are developed in the international public domain whenever possible and contain a LICENSE.md document, as well as a paragraph at the end of each README which contains information about the public domain. We post this information in the README, so that users know the code can be adapted and reused, and so they can easily see this information instead of going to a second site.

Include credit and licenses for embedded resources
If your project includes code or other resources (such as icons, fonts, or photos) from outside sources, your project's license description (in the README, LICENSE, and CONTRIBUTING files) should credit the authors of that work and include their license information.

It's polite to give full credit when reusing work, even if not legally required by the work's license, and this helps users who want to find the original source and use it.

We also have a legal responsibility to respect the licenses of work we use. When adapting or embedding outside work, check its license for instructions for complying with that license.

For example, see "Licenses and attribution" in the U.S. Web Design Standards README. It starts with "A few parts of this project are not in the public domain", to prevent accidentally implying that all the project's files are in the public domain. It lists exceptions in this format: "The file filename is from project name, by name of author [or copyright name of author], under name of license." Then it has a section titled "The rest of this project is in the public domain", with the typical license information we put in READMEs. The project's CONTRIBUTING file includes the same sections. The LICENSE file has the same sections again, plus the full license text for some embedded works and our standard LICENSE information.

List the contact information for your team as well as where to ask questions.
This part of the repo should make it easy for users to get in touch with the team developing the project. This is also where you should list any listservs, chat programs, or social media groups that have been created to keep contributors informed.

Any other information that you’d like to share with users can go in the Wiki section of your repository.
